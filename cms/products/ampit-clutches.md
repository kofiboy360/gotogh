  AMPIT CLUTCHES

  These Aluminium Underarm Crutches are designed for people that have an immobile leg that cannot support any weight.


  They have a comfortable and latex pad that fits securely into the underarm area, allowing the user’s weight to be supported.


  A handgrip on each of the Aluminium Underarm Crutches allows the user to grasp them securely.


  With an aluminium construction, the crutches are extremely lightweight, making them suitable for people with poor levels of strength.


  The double extruded centre tube gives them a high load capacity – the crutches can support users weighing up to 160kg (25 stone).
