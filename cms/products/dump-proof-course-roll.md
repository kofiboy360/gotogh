f_description: "A damp-proof course (DPC) is a vital horizontal or vertical
  moisture barrier installed in building walls, usually just above ground level,
  to prevent ground moisture from rising through the structure via capillary
  action. It acts as a protective, impermeable layer (such as bitumen, plastic,
  or slate) that safeguards against rising damp. "
